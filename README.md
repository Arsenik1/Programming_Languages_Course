# Programming Languages Course

This repository contains homework assignments and projects for a programming languages course. The course covers various programming paradigms and languages, including Flex, Lisp, Yacc, and Prolog, with a focus on language processing, interpretation, and tree building algorithms.

## Homework Assignments

### HW2: Flex and Lisp
- **Flex**: A lexical analyzer for a subset of the C programming language. Instructions for running the Flex projects are available in the Flex README.
- **Lisp**: A simple lexer written in Lisp. Instructions for running the Lisp lexer are detailed in the Lisp README.

### HW3: Lisp and Yacc
- **Lisp**: Enhancements to the Lisp lexer to include interpretation capabilities. For more details, refer to the Lisp README.
- **Yacc**: A parser and interpreter for a subset of the C programming language. Setup and execution instructions can be found in the Yacc README.

### HW4: Prolog and Tree Building
- **Prolog**: The first part involves exercises in Prolog, focusing on logic programming. Documentation for this part is provided in the First Part Documentation PDF.
- **Tree Building**: The second part includes a tree-building algorithm implemented in Python, with the documentation available in the Second Part Documentation PDF. An example of the tree built using the Iris dataset is illustrated in the Iris PDF.

## How to Run

Each homework directory contains specific instructions for running the projects, including necessary commands and environment setup. Please refer to the respective README.txt files and documentation PDFs for detailed guidance.
